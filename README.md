# SPACEWARS
A simple text and logic-based browser game. Evolved from a basic assignment I encounted as Instructional Associate at General Assembly. I've added DOM manipulation to what was originally a console only ui. Also, I have begun the add more complexity to the ships. 

The current work is using this simple app to explore/learn how to destructure javascript apps using modules to keep the app as structurally clean and comprehendible as possible.

The ultimate goal is to add more complexity, connect the spacewars game to a spaceship store where new and used ships, as well as a la carte components, can be bought or sold. This then can re-inform the game to make collection of equipment from captured/destroyed ships how one gains wealth and adds capabilities to the ship. 

Once this complexity has been reached, try making this into a multi-user thing. Spaceships floating in a real dimensinal world. You can battle generic aliens or other users. Perhaps other options cna evolve to include cooperation, etc. At that point you would have to add a server to keep control of the central world. And allow communications between players.

At some point this may also want to transition to a react front end to allow more dynamic experience.
